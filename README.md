# Madness UI


## Current State
* Flask App is able to display the results from what is returned by the service.
* App uses Flexbox to display scores. Scores are currently a static file

## Next Steps
* Port Flask over to pure HTML CSS and JS
* User Creation/Sign In (Needs DB component)
* Admin Portal/Settings

## Status Report 11/30/21
This app is in a pretty decent state for displaying picks, but could definitely use some fine tuning. Below is a screenshot of where I left off for March Madness 2021:

If you would like to see what the current project looks locally, just run `flask start` in the `src/flask` directory and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser of choice. It's not much but it will be there soon
